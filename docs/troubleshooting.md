# Troubleshooting Guide

Solutions to common issues when running HolyClaude.

---

## Common Issues

### CloudCLI shows wrong default directory

**Symptom:** CloudCLI web UI opens to `/home/claude` instead of `/workspace`.

**Cause:** `WORKSPACES_ROOT` environment variable not reaching the CloudCLI process. Docker-compose env vars don't automatically pass through s6-overlay's `s6-setuidgid`.

**Fix:** Already handled in HolyClaude — the s6 run script sets `WORKSPACES_ROOT=/workspace` directly. If you've modified the s6 service scripts, ensure the env var is set in the `env` command.

---

### SQLite "database is locked" errors

**Symptom:** Constant lock errors from CloudCLI account database or other SQLite databases.

**Cause:** SQLite uses file-level locking that CIFS/SMB doesn't support properly.

**Fix:** Don't store SQLite databases on network mounts. HolyClaude keeps `.cloudcli` in container-local storage for this reason. If you're using your own SQLite databases in `/workspace` on a network mount, move them to a local path.

---

### Chromium crashes or blank pages

**Symptom:** Playwright tests fail, screenshots are blank, Lighthouse hangs.

**Cause:** Insufficient shared memory.

**Fix:** Ensure `shm_size: 2g` or higher in your docker-compose file. If running many concurrent tabs, increase to `4g`.

---

### File watchers not detecting changes

**Symptom:** Hot reload doesn't work. Dev servers don't pick up file changes.

**Cause:** Running on SMB/CIFS mounts which don't support `inotify`.

**Fix:** Add polling environment variables:
```yaml
environment:
  - CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=1
  - WATCHFILES_FORCE_POLLING=true
```

Note: Polling uses more CPU than inotify. Only enable when needed.

---

### Permission denied errors

**Symptom:** Can't write files, `git` operations fail, npm install fails.

**Cause:** Container UID/GID doesn't match host file ownership.

**Fix:** Set `PUID` and `PGID` to match your host user:
```bash
# On your host, check your IDs
id -u  # This is your PUID
id -g  # This is your PGID
```

Then in your compose file:
```yaml
environment:
  - PUID=1000
  - PGID=1000
```

---

### `rm -rf *` doesn't delete dotfiles

**Symptom:** Bootstrap sentinel (`.holyclaude-bootstrapped`) survives deletion, so bootstrap never re-runs.

**Cause:** Bash glob `*` doesn't match dotfiles (files starting with `.`).

**Fix:** Target the sentinel directly:
```bash
rm ./data/claude/.holyclaude-bootstrapped
```

Never delete the entire `./data/claude/` directory — this wipes your credentials.

---

### Docker creates `.claude.json` as a directory

**Symptom:** Claude Code CLI crashes on startup with cryptic errors.

**Cause:** If the bind-mount target doesn't exist as a file before container start, Docker creates it as a directory.

**Fix:** Already handled in `entrypoint.sh` — it pre-creates the file if missing. If you're running a custom setup, ensure `~/.claude.json` exists as a file before starting the container.

---

### Claude Code installer hangs during build

**Symptom:** `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash` hangs indefinitely during `docker build`.

**Cause:** Installer prompts or behaves differently when WORKDIR is root-owned.

**Fix:** Already handled in the Dockerfile — `WORKDIR /workspace` and `USER claude` are set before the installer runs.

---

### Bootstrap doesn't re-run after image update

**Symptom:** New settings/memory from updated image aren't applied.

**Cause:** Sentinel file `.holyclaude-bootstrapped` exists, so bootstrap is skipped.

**Fix:**
```bash
rm ./data/claude/.holyclaude-bootstrapped
docker compose restart holyclaude
```

---

## SMB/CIFS Gotchas

If your volumes are on a Samba/CIFS network share (common with Hyper-V VMs, NAS devices):

### No inotify support

File watchers must use polling:
```yaml
- CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=1
- WATCHFILES_FORCE_POLLING=true
```

### No symlinks (without `mfsymlinks`)

npm global installs and Python `.local` can break. This is why HolyClaude keeps `.npm` and `.local` in container-local storage — don't mount them on network shares.

If you need symlinks on CIFS, add `mfsymlinks` to your mount options:
```
//server/share /mnt/share cifs mfsymlinks,... 0 0
```

### SQLite file locking fails

Any SQLite database on CIFS will get "database is locked" errors. Keep SQLite databases on local storage.

### No Unix permissions

`chmod`/`chown` silently succeed but don't actually change permissions on CIFS (depends on mount options). Use `uid=`, `gid=`, `file_mode=`, `dir_mode=` in mount options to set permissions.
