The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.1.7] - 03/28/2026

### Added
- Codex CLI pre-configured with `on-request` approval policy and `workspace-write` sandbox (no more repeated approval prompts)
- Codex, Gemini, and Cursor CLI auth and config persistence across container rebuilds (symlinked into bind-mounted volume)
- Apprise notification hooks for Codex and Gemini CLIs (same `notify-on` flag file as Claude Code)
- Cursor CLI notification hook pre-configured (activates when Cursor CLI adds stop event support)
- Claude Code OAuth session persistence across container recreation (`~/.claude.json` backed up to bind mount)

## [1.1.6] - 03/28/2026

### Fixed
- Codex CLI `apply_patch` failing on Synology NAS and other hosts with restricted user namespaces (bubblewrap sandbox now works via setuid fallback)
- Corrected documentation that incorrectly stated ChatGPT Plus/Pro subscriptions do not work with Codex CLI (they do, via `codex login --device-auth`)

## [1.1.5] - 03/28/2026

### Added
- `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES` file with license attribution for bundled third-party software
- Third-Party Software section in README

## [1.1.4] - 03/28/2026

### Fixed
- Web Terminal plugin stuck on "Connecting..." spinner (WebSocket frame type not preserved in plugin proxy, both relay directions patched)
